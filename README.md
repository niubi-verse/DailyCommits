# Niubi's Natural Commits üíªüåø

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to simulate natural and realistic commit activity.  
Instead of committing every day like a bot (sus!), this workflow:

- Randomly decides whether to commit on a given day
- Makes a random number of commits (1‚Äì5) on selected days
- Adds natural time gaps between each commit (1‚Äì20 minutes)

## ü§ñ How it works

The workflow runs **once daily at 10:00 PM UTC**.

If the day is randomly selected as a commit day, it:
- Updates a file called `commit_number.md`
- Increments the commit number
- Pushes the changes to the repository
- Waits a few minutes between commits to mimic human behavior

This makes your GitHub contribution graph look **active and natural**, without obvious automation patterns.

## üí° Why use this?

Many developers use GitHub contribution graphs to show consistency.  
But constant, repeated commits can look fake or suspicious.  
This approach gives a **more authentic appearance** of activity while keeping your profile looking fresh.
